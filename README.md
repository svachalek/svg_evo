Vector Painting Evolution

This page starts by creating a set of paintings that each contain one oval or triangle.
These paintings are mutated by adding, removing, or altering components, and also
cross-bred with other paintings. The results are compared to the image labeled "Target",
paying particular attention to areas shown in the image labeled "Weights".
The best image and a selection of the others are retained, the rest are thrown out,
and the process repeats.
